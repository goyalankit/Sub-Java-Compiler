Following File shows syntactical error:
1. if the variable has not been declared.
2. If the variable is assigned a value of wrong data type.
3. if the variable is compared with wrong data type
4. If the comparison operator other than == is applied on variable of type String. 
5. It also shows the implementation of break statements in loops.
-------------------------------------------------------
It also shows the assigned values to different variables.
Multiple variables can be declared in a single line.
