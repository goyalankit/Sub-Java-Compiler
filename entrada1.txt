/*
Following File shows:
 
1. int variables are given default value 0. Also you cannot declare a variable twice.
2. Inheritance
3. Parent class object can call the constructor of child class.
4. Child class object cannot call the constructor of parent class. 
5. It also checks whether the class has been defined or not in the code.
6. It also shows that you can define new functions and call them in another functions.
7. At last it shows that break statement cannot be called without loop statement.
